We then examine how these relationships vary according to how frequently citizens exercise voice. Findings indicate respondents\textquoteright use of public sector social media is positively related to perceptions of government trustworthiness.

Drawing upon data from a 2012 sample of 1100 Seoul citizens, findings reveal that greater use of e-government websites is negatively related to citizens' satisfaction and perceptions of public sector trustworthiness. Conversely, use of public sector social media accounts is positively related to satisfaction and perceptions of public sector trustworthiness. Drawing upon the concept of psychological distance, these findings are interpreted to suggest that forms of e-government conducive to the transmission of less detailed information (social media) may be more effective at improving relationships between citizens and their government than forms of e-government that are more commonly used to transmit detailed information (e-government websites).}

abstract = {The premise of our article is that repeated exposure to antipublic sector messages affects the way people evaluate the performance of public sector organizations. More specifically, we argue that individuals\textquoteright implicit attitudes regarding public sector organizations are biased: Citizens automatically and unconsciously associate public sector organizations with inefficiency, inflexibility, and other pejoratives, and these automatic associations color their assessments of public sector performance. Implicit antipublic sector bias has important theoretical implications. It may help to explain whether, and to what degree, individuals respond favorably to positive public sector performance information. More specifically, it suggests that individuals\textquoteright evaluations of government performance will be weighed down by their deep-seated, unconscious views of the public sector; that the effect of information on individuals\textquoteright performance evaluations will be short-lived; and that individuals\textquoteright underlying beliefs about public sector performance will be difficult to change. We design three survey experiments to investigate these propositions, focusing on individuals\textquoteright evaluations of United States Postal Service (USPS) performance. We find evidence for each proposition.}

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) is used as a theoretical framework to explore different information-processing modes that individuals employ in a variety of communication situations. Studies from the fields of communication and psychology are briefly reviewed, with a focus on the source and message strategies that are most likely to persuade different types of audiences to change their nutritional attitudes and behaviors.}

Using experimental research replicated in three European countries, this article investigates the effect of using the European Union (EU) brand on trust in polices. Experiments were conducted among economics students in Belgium, Poland, and the Netherlands to test the hypothesis that adding EU brand elements to policies positively affects trust in those policies. The results show a consistent positive and significant effect of applying the EU brand to trust in the policies in all countries and for both policies included in the experiment\textemdasheven in the Netherlands, a country characterized by a negative overall EU sentiment. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of branding for public policy}

Starting from the premise that information is a key determinant of public opinion and citizen behavior, this research explores the extent to which the time that citizens spend on the Internet affects their trust in government and compliance with government policies, compared with the influence of the traditional, offline, mass media modalities, such as newspapers. In addition, we also assess the impact of citizens\textquoteright use of e-government on levels of trust in government and compliance. The results of the analyses suggest that the more time individuals spend on the Internet, the lower their degree of trust in government and lower level of citizen compliance. However, our results also suggest that such negative effects of the Internet can be moderated through citizens\textquoteright increased use of e-government.}

abstract = {The effect of fear arousal on attitude toward participating in early detection activities [i.e. breast self-examination (BSE)] was studied from an information-processing perspective. It was hypothesized that fear arousal motivates respondents to more argument-based processing of fear-relevant persuasive information. Respondents first read information about breast cancer in which fear was manipulated. After measuring fear arousal, respondents read a persuasive message about performing BSE. Analyses with reported fear, but not manipulated fear, found support for the hypothesis. Respondents who reported mild fear of breast cancer based their attitude toward BSE more on the arguments provided than respondents who reported low fear of breast cancer. This finding suggests that the use of fear arousal may be an efficient tool in health education practice. However, alternative interpretations are provided, in addition to the suggestion to be careful with using fear arousal in health education messages.}
